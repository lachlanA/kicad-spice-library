KiCAD Libraries for SPICE Simulation
====================================

Overview
--------
This is a collection of SPICE libraries for KiCAD.  It is meant to replace the `pspice.lib` that comes with the KiCAD distribution, providing basic elements as well as models for specific components.

Installation
------------
Just put the library files wherever you normally store KiCAD libraries, and make sure that either this location is on KiCADs search path, or that the individual library files are loaded in the KiCAD library browser.
